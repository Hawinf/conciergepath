  bestTimeToVisit:
    "Autumn or spring, specifically October and April, are the best times to travel to the Middle East. Youll avoid the intense summer heat and humidity, while still enjoying pleasant temperatures for both sightseeing and beach relaxation. Summer is extremely hot, and all non-air-conditioned activities become impractical. If you want to avoid the peak tourist season and the risk of heatstroke, visit in winter. Evenings can be cool, and the sun will keep you warm during the day, though its not the ideal time for beach activities.",
